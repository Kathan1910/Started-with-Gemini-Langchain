However, Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, which creates a runaway greenhouse effect and leads to a surface temperature of around 460 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest planet in our solar system.\n",

It has a unique atmosphere that contains oxygen, water, and a variety of other gases necessary for life. Additionally, Earth's magnetic field shields us from harmful solar radiation, making it a habitable planet.\n",

Additionally, Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field, which creates auroras at its poles that are much more powerful than those on Earth."
